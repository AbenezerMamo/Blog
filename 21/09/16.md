In my quest to be a disgruntled Twitter ex employee, my latest act is a blog inside of GitHub to steal market share from their small micro-blog platform.


This actually makes a lot of sense. Make School used to host its curriculum on GitHub and have a front end site pull from it. Free site hosting and you don't have to worry about which parallax or slider is gonna hit your landing page.
This could be the start of something great. This could be the reason I don't pass background checks.....but on the upside: lots of great content. Great outlet for me to dump my useless thoughts on and other great hits. It might even improve my writing. Ha.


Thinking about starting another 100 day challenge but realized it should be 99 because I can't have the same name.... So I might actually make meaningful posts here and do my * talking there. Who knows. But today. Today is a day for lots of decisions. I'm not sure. It seems like a significant day. God willing, hopefully this day means something.
